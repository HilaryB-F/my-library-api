# My Library - Backend


_Where your bookshelf is in your pocket_

My Library was developed for my capstone project at BrainStation for my Software Engineering bootcamp, but has quickly become a passion project for me. I hope to continue working on this project in the future (if anyone is interested in investing, please contact me!).

My Library is a custom bookshelf that helps you keep track of all of your books. You have control on how your bookshelf looks and feels. 

My Library was created using create-react-app, react-router, sass and a few external libraries including, toastify and star rating. On the back end I used a Node/Express API. I hope to move towards using MYSQL and an authentication method in the future.

I hope you enjoy browsing the books as much as I do! ðŸ“š
